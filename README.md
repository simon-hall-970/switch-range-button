# Switch range control component for React

This project is to build a UI component that can be used to control a true false value in redux state and also a range input in the redux state.

The intention is that 
- a single left click on the element will toggle the switch to change a redux state to true or false.
- holding down a right click will engage a range slider control and moving the mouse up and down while holding 

Check it works on mobile devices as well.
