# Switch range control component for React

This project is to build a UI component that uses different mouse events to control both a switch and range input with a single element.

## Use goals
- a single left click on the element will toggle the switch to change a state between true or false.
- holding down a right click while moving the mouse up and down will control a range input and set the state accordingly.

## Styles
The style of the element should change depending on the values in state.  The component uses styled-components for the styling to make use of js variables in the css properties.  




Check it works on mobile devices as well.
